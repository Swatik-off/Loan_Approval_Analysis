# Loan_Approval_Analysis
Data analysis of loan approval dataset using Python – explored applicant income, loan size, and loan status using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn
# 🏦 Loan Approval Data Analysis Project

A beginner-friendly yet insightful **data analytics project** where I explore how **loan approval decisions** are influenced by factors such as **applicant income**, **loan amount**, and **loan size categories**.

This project uses real-world-inspired data to create meaningful **data visualizations** and perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using **Python**, **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

To analyze and visualize the patterns in **loan approval** based on:
- **Loan amount requested**
- **Applicant income**
- **Approval status**
- **Loan size category**

And to draw **insights** that may help financial institutions in understanding customer patterns better.

## 💡 Key Features

✅ Data cleaning & transformation  
✅ Categorization of loan sizes (Small, Medium, Large)  
✅ Pie chart for **loan size distribution**  
✅ Box plot to compare **income distribution** for approved vs non-approved applicants  
✅ Count plot of **loan approval frequency**  
✅ Insights with **Markdown annotations** for better presentation

## 📊 Visual Insights

- **Box Plot:** Visual comparison of income levels between approved and not approved loan applicants  
- **Pie Chart:** Distribution of loan applications across loan size categories  
- **Bar Chart:** Frequency of approvals vs rejections based on loan size  

These visualizations help in understanding the patterns and potentially building future **ML-based loan eligibility models**.
